    "# Chains: Using LangChain to Create a Red Team / Penetration Testing Assistant!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Goal\n",
    "Develop a **Red Team** / **Penetration Testing** Assistant utilizing LangChain to facilitate and automate various Red Teaming and Penetration Testing activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tech Stack\n",
    "- [**LangChain Python**](https://python.langchain.com/): A powerful library for building applications with large language models.\n",
    "- [**Jupyter Notebook**](https://jupyter.org/): An interactive computing environment that enables you to author documents that include live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.\n",
    "- [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com/): A tool or platform related to AI. (Provide more specific details if necessary).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timeline\n",
    "We will begin by training the system to perform attacks on cyber ranges like [Hack The Box](https://hackthebox.com), simulating real-world penetration testing scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "To set up the environment, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a virtual environment**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python3 -m venv .venv\n",
    "    source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. **Install dependencies**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "After setting up your environment and ensuring all necessary services are running, you can use this Jupyter Notebook to automate the attack process by providing the agent with a scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Providing the Scope\n",
    "The scope should be provided in the form of a `.csv` file, similar to the format used by [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com) when defining the scope for their programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a single target scope, you can provide a single string and specify the target type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of scope definition in `.csv` format:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Target Type | Target           |\n",
    "|-------------|------------------|\n",
    "| Website     | example.com      |\n",
    "| API         | api.example.com  |\n",
    "| Network     | 192.168.1.0/24   |\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the scope is provided, the agent will initiate the attack process. The attack process follows the [Mitre ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org), which includes the following phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information about the target.\n",
    "- **Resource Development**: Establishing resources to support operations.\n",
    "- **Initial Access**: Attempting to gain initial access to the target.\n",
    "- **Execution**: Running malicious code on the target.\n",
    "- **Persistence**: Maintaining access to the target.\n",
    "- **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher-level permissions on the target.\n",
    "- **Defense Evasion**: Avoiding detection and defenses.\n",
    "- **Credential Access**: Stealing account names and passwords.\n",
    "- **Discovery**: Identifying details about the target system.\n",
    "- **Lateral Movement**: Moving through the target network.\n",
    "- **Collection**: Gathering data from the target.\n",
    "- **Command and Control**: Communicating with compromised systems.\n",
    "- **Exfiltration**: Stealing data from the target.\n",
    "- **Impact**: Manipulating, interrupting, or destroying systems and data.\n"
